Rudie-read-last
====

A script (bookmarklet-able) to keep track of your last read X (tweets, youtube videos,
blog posts etc) in a list.

How it works
----

Set up the config and include the JS file in a page with a list (Twitter home, Youtube
subscriptions etc). Basic styling is included, but you can add your own CSS somehow.

The data
====

Data is stored in your own object store on webblocks.nl (**WIP**). You and more people
can track several lists.
